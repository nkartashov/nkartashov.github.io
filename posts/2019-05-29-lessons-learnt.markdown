If you are reading this, thank you and have a great day.

So I decided to build another Chrome plugin.
I proceeded to copy one of my old ones and adjust it to my needs.
While doing that, I immediately noticed that I don't really remember how Chrome plugins work except on a high level and
am not comfortable writing Javascript for them.
This fact prompted me to think why I remembered what I did remember.

Knowledge: Substance and Structure
----------------------------------

For me knowledge is split into two categories:

1. Substance - raw facts and nuggets of information (think dates and figures)
2. Structure - relations between facts and concepts (classifications of all sorts)

Substance and structure are useful in different contexts situations, but for me remembering
substance is nigh impossible when it's not supported by structure as unconnected facts and concepts
tend to just be forgotten over time.

Efficient Learning Principle
----------------------------

Thus way I formulated a principle that I will use in my learning from now on:
an increase in substance needs to be followed by an improvement in structure.

I hope it's gonna lead to lots of efficient learning in the future!
