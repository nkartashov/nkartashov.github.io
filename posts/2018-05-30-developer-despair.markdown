If I manage to finish this one in time, that would reduce the time between posts from three to two months, which may be a sign of a good trend.
Or a sign of nothing. Welp, sometimes I wonder if anyone reads my posts at all as I have not been able/was too lazy to hook up Google Analytics.
Anyway, onward to today's post.

We have just recently released our [app](https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/buddify/id1109432813) on the AppStore.
Be sure to download it!
While you are downloading the app, I will tell you a funny story.
Usually I work on the app on Saturdays and today (26.05.2018) I did the same.
After talking to my co-founder Anant and discussing all possible way to attract users to the app I was suddenly hit by an intense feeling of despair.
Despair caused by looking into the abyss of future work needed to succeed with the app.
I have seen all the days and nights of work to build features and infrastructure to support them, the meetings with outside people,
and the tons of boring generic code to generate reports and dashboards to persuade the future partners.
And this is the worst feeling you can have while working on anything that is unfinished.
This is a feeling that makes your attention wander and your resolve crack.

Embrace challenges
------------------

Personally, I try to picture my next steps, be it my next project in the company, next job, even my dream project/company and choose to work on whatever problem
contributes to my success in the future the most.
In the example above, I chose a frontend ticket because I worked as a Full Stack Engineer and wanted to improve in the
area needed for my work in which I wasn't at my strongest.

Finally, I would like to stress that LTP is just guidance that I try to follow to maximize learning and improvement in my life
but no doubt there are moments when LTP falls short and produces bad results.
For example, if your life outside work is not all rainbows and unicorns at the moment, additional challenge may not be something you want to pursue.
As LTP is not a strict system of rules, I think it may be adapted to one's preferences, ambitions and environment.

Hopefully, this post was useful, I'm going back to the void of real life. See ya.
