title: Attrition Theorem

No promises on timings this time, let's just get started.


As of late I have thought a lot about developer compensation and how it influences one's decision to switch companies.
Here are some things that I noticed (based on personal anecdotes and first-hand accounts):
1. Developer market is extremely hot right now
2. Most of salary increase company policies are garbage and companies are more reluctant to increase one's salary when already employed
3. Promotion policies are vague and one is unlikely to be promoted especially if one doesn't work on one specific high-value project

Given all that, I would like to formulate the Attrition Theorem:
As long as (1), (2) and (3) are valid, developers will be incentivised to switch companies in order to increase monetary part of their compensation

Let's try to unpack this.
